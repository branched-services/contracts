///
///         The `RouterHandler` handler fuzzes `swap()` and `swapMulti()` across a bounded token
///         universe (4 ERC20s + NATIVE_ETH_SENTINEL), three rotating users, fee bps in `[0, 200]`,
///         and both values of `partnerFeeOnOutput` and `passPositiveSlippageToUser`. Per-call, the
///         handler records the exact components (pulled, forwarded, produced, userReceived, each
///         partner-fee side, protocolFee, positiveSlippage) into token-keyed ghost accumulators.
///         This file then asserts three invariants derived from the spec line above.
///
///         Runs under `foundry.toml`'s `invariant = { runs = 256, depth = 15 }` with
///         `fail_on_revert = false` (default) so that handler calls whose randomly-drawn inputs
///         would revert on the Router's own validation paths are discarded from the sequence
///         rather than failing the run.
